        <h2>Welcome to Wonderland</h2>
        <p>The Red Queen has thrown a rare and elaborate "Peace Ball" at the palace to celebrate a full year of peace in Wonderland. But peace is fleeting—before the evening can reach its crescendo, a scream tears through the air.</p>
        <p>Guests discover the March Hare's body just beyond the Grand Hall. His body lies crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood.</p>
        <p>The scene is a mess and the guests are terrified.</p>
        <p>The Queen demands answers and has already ordered that nobody can leave the ball until this is solved. You are the investigators.</p>
        <p>Your first task: Investigate the crime scene.</p>
        <p><em>Please do not disturb the items at the crime scene! Take pics, take notes, but be respectful of other investigators and leave all items where they are!</em></p>

        <h2>The Crime Scene</h2>
        <p>You examine the cobblestone where the March Hare fell. Blood has pooled across the stones around the March Hare, oozing out of his ears, mouth, and nose. More disturbingly, though, is his eyes are missing. There appears to be no signs of punctures or visible wounds aside from the eyes, and his body is... broken. Multiple broken ribs. <p>You examine his clothing and a thick, brown, goopy substance is splashed across the Hare’s shirt and appears to have soaked through his vest, meaning this happened before he died.</p>
        <p>A bowler hat—unusual for the Hare—sits nearby with a bloody smear on it.</p>
        <p>Near the outline of his body lies a blood-stained note folded in half. Inside, there’s no message—just a scrawled letter and number: R²</p>
        <p>You feel the sensation you're being watched and you turn just in time to see a fading smile. You recall the one who’s everywhere and nowhere. The Cheshire Cat may have seen something.</p>
         <p>Find the Cheshire Cat somehwere in the ball. Look for their large, red paws and striped socks and they'll likely be carrying a notebook. Approach them as ask if they know anything about the murder.</p>

        <h2>The Cheshire Cat</h2>
        <p>You find the Cheshire Cat floating among the crowd, their grin stretching impossibly wide. They chuckle softly as you approach.</p>
        <blockquote>"Ahhh, my favorite guests. Always chasing tales, aren't we? Well, well… the game’s afoot. Or a paw. Or a tail. It's a sad thing, that has happened to the poor March Hare. He was a.. well he was alive. Quite mad, too. I have been here with the guests all night, if you're concerned about my part in all of this. Do you think this incorporeal form can break bones? I think not. I did notice something strange, though. A shadow moving nearby, but to find it, you'll need to solve my riddle first."</blockquote>
        <p>Here, the Cheshire Cat smiles and appears to enjoy the spectacle of it all and is, somehow, amused? They speak in riddles, offering you a challenge rather than a confession.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “The truth you seek is hiding still,<br>
        Between the lines, beneath the thrill.<br>
        Bound in pages, fiction’s mask—<br>
        To find the clue, complete the task.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>You think about this riddle, knowing this is all you'll get from the cat. Is there something else hidden here?</p>
        <p><em>Solve the riddle and find the next clue somewhere inside the venue.</em></p>
        <p><em>After you find the next clue, take note of it, snap a photo, return it, and then it's then time to find Alice and ask some pointed questions. Look for her dark brown hair, telltale Alice outfit but with blood spattered on it? She'll be carrying a notebook. Approach and ask if they know anything about the murder.</em></p>

        <h2>Alice</h2>
        <p>You find Alice near the garden wall, her face pale but composed. She straightens her dress as you approach. You question her involvement with the murder.</p>
        <blockquote>"Me? No. I would never hurt him. The March Hare and I—we’ve always been friends. Good friends. I was at the dinner table and then went outside to get an apple since all the food was gone."</blockquote>
        <p>You question her about the blood on her dress. She looks down at the red stains.</p>
        <blockquote>"This? Cocktail sauce. That Walrus eats like a... well a Walrus, I suppose. As soon as the shrimp came out, he became... quite 'enthused' about it and I should have avoided the splash zone."</blockquote>
        <p>You question her about the hat you saw at the crime scene and in the strange note. She looks at you quizzically.</p>
        <blockquote>"My hat? I borrowed one of Tweedle Dee’s hats for the night. I made my entrance and checked it at the coat rack when I arrived. So many coats, I have no idea where it went."</blockquote>
        <p>She gestures toward the Grand Hall’s coat rack. "You want answers? Maybe you should go digging for evidence instead of pointing fingers at the March Hare's friends."</p>
      <p>You look around for coats. Is there something else hidden here?</p>
        <p><em>Find the next clue somewhere inside the venue.</em></p>
        <p><em>After you find the next clue, take note of it, snap a photo, return it, and then it's then time to find the Mad Hatter.</em></p>

        <h2>The Coats</h2>
        <p>You search through the pockets of the coats and find a crumpled receipt. It's stained with blood and is an order for a custom hat from the Mad Hatter and paid for by the March Hare.</p>
        <p>The receipt is dated yesterday.</p>
        <blockquote>"Hello. Sorry to frighten you. I have heard the most dreadful things this evening. The March Hare, my one true friend. My tea companion. He always served me first. So proper, he was. I remember him rushing past me — the March Hare. He didn’t check his coat, didn't say hello. That was odd. But what I really remember was the smell. It was savory. Definitely a stew. Meat stew. And the Hare? He’s a vegetarian. Has been all his life.”"</blockquote>
        <p>The Doormouse sighed.</p>
        <blockquote>"How sad, my dear old friend. He was so excited for his new deck being finished yesterday so he might host us for tea upon it. Please find who did this to him? He and the Hatter had been angry with each other, but I don't think he could have done this, do you?"</blockquote>
     
      <p>The Hatter and the March Hare were angry with each other? Meat stew?</p>
        <p><em>It's time to find the Mad Hatter and ask some pointed questions. Look for his curled mustache and tall hat. He'll also be carrying a notebook. Approach and ask if they know anything about the murder.</em></p>

        <h2>The Mad Hatter</h2>
        <p>The Hatter smooths his curled mustache and welcomes you with a crooked smile. You question his involvement with the murder and the receipt you just found.</p>
        <blockquote>"Me? I was with the Queen all evening. She was in quite the tizzy about the food situation. I do love when her majesty's face becomes as red as her dress."</blockquote>
        <p>You question the receipt.</p>
        <blockquote>"Ah, yes, that receipt. I made the Hare a new hat just yesterday. Sapphire ribbon, hand-stitched. He came and picked it up and we had a delightful conversation about expressing ones feelings with abandon."</blockquote>
        <p>You question the blood on the receipt and his relationship with the March Hare.</p>
        <blockquote>"Mine, I’m afraid. Pricked my finger. Adds character, don’t you think? Ah. Yes, we've had disagreements. Most recently, we argued about where to host the tea parties. I said they should continue in the forest, he wanted it at his home. Only small, harmless arguments between friends."</blockquote>
        <p>He grows serious.</p>
        <blockquote>"The Hare was furious yesterday, though, when he picked up his hat. Said the Carpenter finished the new deck that morning, but that it was awful because it was perfectly straight! But the Carpenter still demanded payment. He told him off and the Carpenter walked back home, also angry. The Hare said, ‘I’m going to his house right after this.’ I gave him a receipt and he stormed off wearing his brand new, beautiful, one of a kind hat."</blockquote>
        <p>"Oh, and yesterday morning, I overheard the Queen screaming in her throne room to one of her people. I didn't catch it all but she yelled ‘Off with his head’ and a servant came out later shaking their head muttering about the March Hare.  While we have enjoyed a year of peace, the Queen is still as cranky as ever. She just hides it better now. Maybe there's something there?"</p>
        <p>Hm. The Queen?</p>
        <p><em>It's time to find the Queen of Hearts and ask some pointed questions.</em></p>
        <p><em>Find the Queen of Hearts. Look for her long dark hair, long red dress, and crown. She'll also be carrying a notebook. Approach and ask if they know anything about the murder.</em></p>

        <h2>The Queen of Hearts</h2>
        <p>You find the Queen pacing, livid. You begin to ask her about her involvement in the night's murder, but she snaps and interrupts you.</p>
        <blockquote>"Have you figured this out yet?! This entire evening has been a complete disaster! The food vanished before most of the guests arrived because that selfish nitwit the Walrus was eating everything in sight, someone was seen digging in my rose bushes, dnd now—murder. And that idiot Hatter just giggling in my ear the entire night. And don't you dare accuse me, the Queen of Hearts, of involvement with this. I was here at the dinner the entire time and if I wanted the Hare dead, I would have done so publicly, not sneaking around like some rat."</blockquote>
        <p>She snarls, then composes herself.</p>
        <blockquote>"In addition to all of this mess, I had invited the Royal Carpenter to dine at my table. He never arrived. I sent guards to his home. No answer. Can you imagine someone ignoring MY requests? The disrespect of being an honored guest and not arriving nor answering."</blockquote>
        <p>She scoffs.</p>
         <blockquote>"Then, one of my guards saw that my roses had been assaulted! I ordered a search of the rose garden. They found a box... half-buried. Find the killer, detective! We've already had one tragedy this evening! Let's not make another and end the ball on such a sour note. He was a hare who probably crossed the wrong person. He was even caught a couple of days ago stealing carrots from my own garden. Can we move on? Why didn't somebody tell me to have more than seafood for dinner?! Someone will pay for this oversight!" </blockquote>
        <p>She leaves in a huff. As she walks away from you, you spot the Walrus standing a short distance away, red stains on his shirt, standing sheepishly attempting to flag you down.</p><p>
        <strong>Do you approach the Walrus?</strong> <a href="?code=walrus">Click to discuss.</a></p>

        <p><em>If not, she said something about a box? Go and search through the venue and find the box. Where would the Queen's guards put the box?

He'll likely be carrying a notebook.</em></p>

  <h1>The Walrus</h1>
  <p>As you approach the Walrus — dressed in a blue, velvet-trimmed tuxedo, top hat slightly askew, red stains on his shirt, concern etched across his jowled face.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Forgive me for intruding… but I couldn’t help overhearing. The Carpenter... is missing? That is extremely concerning.<br><br>
    He left our house three days ago — we're roommates, you see - said something about heading to the palace. He'd told me about his new appointment as "Royal Carpenter", so I assumed he left the home and was not only here, but also living here.<br><br>
    And now, the March Hare too? It’s terrible. Just terrible.”<br><br>
    (He leans in slightly, voice lowering.)<br><br>
    “If you ask me... those Tweedles are more trouble than they’re worth. Always stirring things up, which is why the Queen didn't even invite them to the Peace Ball. I wouldn’t be surprised if one of them had something to do with this.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>His face droops. You mention his shirt. He looks down and shrugs.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Cocktail sauce. I'm not the most... refined eater, I suppose.They had seafood.”
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>The Walrus shrugs again, tips his hat to you and smiles sadly, but politely, turns on his heel and walks away. The Queen said something about a box? Go and search through the venue and find the box. Where would the Queen's guards put the box? There might be something important to the investigation inside. </em></p>`,

        <div class="screenshot-note">Take a screenshot of this page to use as reference throughout your investigation!</div>
        <h2>The Buried Box</h2>
        <p>You find a small box. A chest, really. Inside, a message waits, handwritten and stained with something dark.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “Curiosity may have led you here...<br>
        But it won’t help you sleep tonight.”<br><br>
        I’ve been everywhere and nowhere—watching you chase ghosts through shadows.<br><br>
        The March Hare?<br>
        He didn’t deserve it.<br>
        He was just... a loose thread.<br><br>
        Loose threads unravel things.<br>
        And sometimes, those things are soft.<br><br>
        Delicate.<br>
        Squishy.<br>
        Salty.<br><br>
        This is becoming quite the rousing adventure, no?<br>
        How close are you to solving my puzzles?<br>
        Hopefully close enough that you find me...<br>
        before I find my next victim.”
        </blockquote>
      
        <p>There's one last person to speak to. Go and find the White Rabbit, the last to talk to. He'll be wearing a white vest and a top hat. He'll likely be carrying a notebook.One last stop: the White Rabbit.</p>

        <h2>The White Rabbit</h2>
        <p>You approach the White Rabbit, who is nervously stamping his foot just outside the doors of the Grand Hall and checking his pocket watch. He looks over at you and says,</p>
        <blockquote>"Finally! You're late. I was expecting you to come and speak to me much earlier in your investigation! What do you need?!"</blockquote>
        <p>You ask him a series of questions about his whereabouts during the evening and things he may have seen.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “For the majority of the night, I was out in the garden. The air inside was thick with the smell of fish and shrimp and oysters and meat stew and it turned my stomach and wrinkled my nose, you see, because I'm a herbivore. Like the Hare. So I came out to the garden and I was talking with Alice as we ate apples in the garden. She went back inside when I saw the March Hare rush past on the other side of the garden. He was pale, terrified. I could hear him nearly shrieking—‘I must tell the Queen. The poor Carpenter, his eyes were gone!’<...
        I had no idea what that meant, and it was shortly after that I heard it. A scream. A crunch. Like twigs snapping.”
        </blockquote>
        <p></em>Time to solve it: Who killed the Hare? How? Why? There is also something strange about these notes being left. What do the numbers mean? You've only seen one thing with numbers tonight. The safe. Solve this and maybe it's the safe combo?</em></p>
